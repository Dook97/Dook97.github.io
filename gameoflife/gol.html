                        <h3>What is the Game of Life?</h3>
                        <hr />
                        <p>In short a simple algorith with interesting life-like properties.</p>
                        <p>
                            Basically there's an infinite grid and each of the grid's cells is thought of as a living thing. The cells have eight neighbours, that is all the other
                            cells with which they share one or two corners. A cell can either be alive or dead. If a cell is alive and has two or three living neighbours it
                            continues to stay alive during the next run of the algorithm. If a cell is dead and has exactly three living neighbours it comes to life in the next
                            iteration. In all other cases the cell either stays or becomes dead.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my particular implementation the grid isn't infinite, which AFAIK is the case for all programmatic implementations, only some of them are clever
                            about postponing and hiding the fact. In this implementation neighbourship wraps around edges, which can produce some nice effects.
